## Conventions

### Firmware Types

| Type Number |     Definition     |
|-------------|--------------------|
|      1      |  No direct root strategy known (*yet*), however it is easy to replace with a directly rootable firmware. Can also be rooted indirectly from `Type 2` firmware. |
|      2      |  Direct and easy root strategy is known. Can be used for indirect root strategies for other firmware *Types*. |
|      3      |  No direct root strategy known (*yet*), hard to replace with a directly rootable firmware. Also can be rooted indirectly from `Type 2` firmware. |
|     ???     |   No known direct root strategy tested yet, some of them may work just fine, may be hard, to replace with a directly rootable firmware. May be able to be rooted indirectly from `Type 2` firmware. No experience has been shared from users on such firmware. If you think you know something more about that please tell us. |
